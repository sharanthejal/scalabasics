#Scala Sets
-- There are mainly two types of sets avaiable in Scala.
-- As we know, Set won't allow duplicate elements and it implements Traversable and Iterable. And Traversable is the base Trait for all the Collections.
Immutable //default
Mutable
-- To get the mutable set have to invoke it using import collection.mutable.set
