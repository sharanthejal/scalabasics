#Programming Constructs in Scala
-- Print functions are of two types as below
println("This will take the cursor to the new line")
print("This will take the cursor at the end of the statement")

--math is a package object which is entirely available to the scala libary, scala.math which contains many functions to do log, trig, numeric operations
-- Assigning data to a variable using a block
scala> val a= {
     | val i= 1
     | val j=math.pow(2,10)
     | j-i
     | }
a: Double = 1023.0

--math.random will always will a double value between 0 and 1.

#If clause in scala, it is like in java only
-- go to paste mode, :paste
val i: Int=10
val j: Int=20
if(i > j){
println("i is greater than j")
}
else if(i < j){
println("i is lesser than j")
}
else
println("i is equal to j")

#while loop is also similar to how it is done in Java
-- example, print the values from 100 to 90 using while loop
var ctr=100
while(ctr>90){
println(ctr)
ctr= ctr-1
}

#for loop
--example, print the vales from 1 to 10 using simple for loop
-- i to j by -2 can be used for decrementing the value
val i=1
val j=10
for(e <- i to j by 1)
{
println(e)
}

Range plus combination example --  count of even and odd numbers from 1 to 100 in scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

var totalEven=0
var totalOdd=0
for(element <- (1 to 100) ){
if(element % 2==0) totalEven+= element else totalOdd+= element
}
println("Total Even count is :  "+totalEven)
println("Total Odd count is : "+totalOdd)

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

Total Even count is :  2550
Total Odd count is : 2500
totalEven: Int = 2550
totalOdd: Int = 2500
