#Scala Collections Sequence
-- It is mainly of two types
1. Indexed Sequence
2. Linear Sequence

-- Sequence have length.
-- Elements in sequence can be accessed using prefix.
-- List is a case class, so only no need to use new operator while creating object. It will invoke apply method. //val l=List(1,2,3)
Example:
scala.Array  					//Mutable
scala.collection.immutable.List //Immutable

val l=List(1,400,3)
-- In Scala parenthesis() are used to access the elements in the collection unlike in Java where square brackets[] are used.
scala> l(1)
res2: Int = 400
